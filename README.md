You can use this program to reproduce what we described in the paper.

1. Please download the pretrained model, and put it in the directory ``SOIP-main`` after decompression.

2. You must to have a usb camera to detect your face.

And then, run the ``demo.py``

For better performance, we strongly recommend using the same version as ours.
